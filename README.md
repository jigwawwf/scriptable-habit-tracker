 That is all :)

### Customization :

You can change the name of the habit in settings
And if you want to change the dot and font sizes (might be chaotic) press advanced settings.

#### Advanced Settings

- Dot Size ( 3 by default )
- Dot Spacing ( 3 by default )
- Font Size ( 14 by default )

These are five themes built-in you can play with colors in the code.
